# Zequs API

Date: October 21, 2016

Document Version: v1.2

# Overview
This document describes the Zequs API v1.0, which supports queuing of images
from a client for handling by Zequs. The Zequs API provides a RESTful JSON 
interface for interacting with and managing the Zequs print queue.

# Common Responses
The Zequs API utilizes HTTP response codes to inform clients of the success
or failure of each request. Clients should use the HTTP response code to
trigger error handling if necessary. This section discusses various API error
responses.

* 200 - A request succeeded.
* 400 - Bad request
* 404 - Not found
* 500 - Internal Error

# JSON Results
All Zequs API results are in the form of JSON. In some cases, the JSON is an
empty object, when no meaningful data is to be returned.

# Get information about a specific print job

## GET /api/v1/zequs/{id}/

### Headers
* Accept (string) - application/json

### Path Parameters
Numeric ID of print job. The id was returned when the print job was created, 
and will be valid until the print job is deleted.

### Query Parameters

### Request Examples
```
GET /api/v1/zequs/17/ HTTP/1.1

```

## Response
#### Status code
* 200 - OK

### Response Body
Returns a JSON object that describes the status of the job. This status
consists of two fields. 

* 'id' is the print job ID. 
* 'state' is the state of the job, and can be one of the following values:

* 0 - queued 
* 1 - printing
* 2 - failed
* 3 - complete

### Response Examples
```
{
    "id": 17

   "failed": 0,
   "complete": 6
}
```
___

## Delete a job
Removes a job. If queued, it is removed from the queue. Completed or failed
jobs are retained until explicitly deleted (this allows a client to poll for
job status to determine the print job state)

### Delete /api/v1/zequs/{id}/

#### Path Parameters
id - numeric ID of the print job, which was returned when the print job was
created

#### Query Parameters
None.

```
DELETE /api/v1/zequs/18/ HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.10.4:8080
Accept: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

### Response
#### Status code

### POST /api/v1/zequs/

#### Headers

#### Path Parameters
None.

#### Query Parameters
None.

#### Request Body
A JSON object that contains the image data and a filename prefix. The data 
member consists of a base-64 encoded string that represents the image to 
be printed. The image encoding is arbitrary. The filename prefix is a string
of zero or more characters that can be used as a part of the filename 
created by zequs for spooling. This hint will be prepended to any filename
generated by zequs. A good choice for this prefix is the last name of the
person for which the badge is being printed.

#### Request Examples
```
POST /api/v1/zequs/ HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.10.4:8080
Content-Type: application/json
